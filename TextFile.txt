1. A Repository is nothing but a simple c# class that contains the logic to retrieve data 
from the database and map it to the model

2. A controller is responsible for responding to the incoming HTTP requests with the applicable HTTP response

3. A ViewModel contains the various properties to hold/represent the data. This data is displayed on our View of 
the application. ViewModel doesn't need to have all read/write properties. This data is meant to be shown to the 
end user on the UI page
